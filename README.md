I really enjoy working in the fields of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Material Science, and Machine Learning. My goal is to find a job in the tech industry, education, or financial sector where I leverage my strong analytical and technical abilities to drive data-driven decisions that will positively impact the company's prosperity.
