I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics and a Master's degree in Mathematical Sciences, specializing in Data Science. I have strong expertise in data analysis, utilizing tools such as Python and STATA. My daily responsibilities primarily involve working on impact evaluation research projects, where I focus on coding data collection instruments using SurveyCTO and developing Google Sheets dashboards.
In addition, I am skilled in data cleaning and field report writing. I have extensive experience with various techniques for data monitoring and cleaning, applicable to both primary and secondary datasets. My ultimate goal is to strengthen my research skills as I work toward pursuing a Ph.D. in Data Science, Mathematical Epidemiology, or Public Health. Currently I work in a research-focused organization which is an excellent opportunity to enhance my research capabilities while contributing to impactful work that addresses real-world challenges.
